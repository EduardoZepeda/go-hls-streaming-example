# go-hls-streaming-example

A simple example of HLS streaming with Go for [one of my blog's posts](https://coffeebytes.dev/stremea-tus-videos-y-audios-una-introduccion-sencilla-al-streaming-con-hls-para-tus-aplicaciones/)(written in spanish, though).

## Quickstart

Before starting, remember to install all the required packages.

``` bash
go install
```

If everything went correctly, just run the project as always.

``` bash
go run main.go
```

This will create a server running on the port 8000 on localhost. Feel free to examine the network tab in your browser to see the streaming working in your browser.
